<h2>PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p class="para">The Introduction, by which the present work is ushered into public
notice, renders any lengthened Preface on my part quite unnecessary.
Yet I wish to say a few words with regard to the design and plan of
this little volume.</p>

<p class="para">The subject, though no doubt possessing a peculiar interest to the
general reader, and especially to tourists in these travelling
days, falls naturally under the head of historical and geographical
instruction in schools; and for such use the book is, in the first
place, specially intended.</p>

<p class="para">When I was myself one of a class in this city where Geography and
History were taught, no information connected with etymology was
imparted to us. We learned, with more or less trouble and edification,
the names of countries, towns, etc., by rote; but our teacher did not
ask us who gave the names to these places, nor were we expected to
inquire or to know if there was any connection between their names
and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span> histories. Things are changed now; and I believe the first
stimulus to an awakening interest in Geographical Etymology was given
by the publication of the Rev. Isaac Taylor’s popular work, <i>Words
and Places</i>. About ten years ago, I found that the best teachers in
the English schools of Edinburgh did ask questions on this subject,
and I discovered, at the same time, that a book specially bearing
upon it was a desideratum in school literature. As no one better
qualified came forward, I was induced to make the attempt; and I hope
the following pages, the result of much research and in the face of no
small discouragement, may prove useful to teachers, as well as to their
pupils.</p>

<p class="para">The Index at the end of the volume, although it contains many names
not included in the body of the work, does by no means include all
that I have given there. This did not seem necessary, because, the
root words being alphabetically arranged, an intelligent teacher or
pupil will easily find the key to the explanation of any special name
by referring to the head under which it is naturally classed. I must,
however, premise that, with regard to names derived from the Celtic
languages, the root word is generally placed at the beginning of the
name&mdash;that is, if it contain more than one syllable. This is the case
with such vocables as <i>pen</i>, <i>ben</i>, <i>dun</i>, <i>lis</i>,
<i>rath</i>, <i>strath</i>, etc.; <i>e.g.</i> Lismore, Benmore,
Dungarvan, Strath-Allan. On the other hand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[vii]</span> in names derived from
the Teutonic or Scandinavian languages, the root word comes last, as
will be found with regard to <i>ton</i>, <i>dale</i>, <i>burg</i>,
<i>berg</i>, <i>stadt</i>, <i>dorf</i>, <i>ford</i>, etc.</p>

<p class="para">The index, therefore, may be expected to include principally such names
as, either through corruption or abbreviation, have materially changed
their form, such as are formed from the simple root, like Fürth, Ennis,
Delft, or such as contain more than one, as in Portrush, it being
uncertain under which head I may have placed such names. Along with the
root words, called by the Germans <i>Grundwörter</i>, I have given a
number of defining words (<i>Bestimmungswörter</i>)&mdash;such adjectives as
express variety in colour, form, size, etc.</p>

<p class="para">It is to be regretted that many names have necessarily been omitted
from ignorance or uncertainty with regard to their derivation. This
is the case, unfortunately, with several well-known and important
towns&mdash;Glasgow, Berlin, Berne, Madrid, Paisley, etc. With regard to
these and many others, I shall be glad to receive reliable information.</p>

<p class="para">And now it only remains for me to express my obligations to the
gentlemen who have kindly assisted me in this work, premising that,
in the departments which they have revised, the credit of success is
due mainly to them; while I reserve to myself any blame which may be
deservedly attached to failures or omissions. The Celtic portion of
my proof-sheets has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span> revised by Dr. Skene, the well-known Celtic
scholar of this city, and by Dr. Joyce, author of <i>Irish Names
of Places</i>. I have also to thank the Rev. Isaac Taylor, author
of <i>Words and Places</i>, for the help and encouragement which
he has given me from time to time; and Mr. Paterson, author of the
<i>Magyars</i>, for valuable information which I received from him
regarding the topography of Hungary. I appreciate the assistance given
me by these gentlemen the more, that it did not proceed from personal
friendship, as I was an entire stranger to all of them. It was the
kindness and courtesy of the stronger and more learned to one weaker
and less gifted than themselves; and I beg they may receive my grateful
thanks, along with the little volume which has been so much their
debtor.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p class="para">Among the branches of human speculation that, in recent times, have
walked out of the misty realm of conjecture into the firm land of
science, and from the silent chamber of the student into the breezy
fields of public life, there are few more interesting than Etymology.
For as words are the common counters, or coins rather, with which we
mark our points in all the business and all the sport of life, any man
whose curiosity has not been blunted by familiarity, will naturally
find a pleasure in understanding what the image and superscription on
these markers mean; and amongst words there are none that so powerfully
stimulate this curiosity as the names of persons and places. About
these the intelligent interest of young persons is often prominently
manifested; and it is a sad thing when parents or teachers, who should
be in a position to gratify this interest, are obliged to waive an
eager intelligence aside, and by repeated negations to repel the
curiosity which they ought to have encouraged. Geography indeed,
a subject full of interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span> to the young mind, has too often been
taught in such a way as neither to delight the imagination with vivid
pictures, nor to stimulate inquiry by a frequent reference to the
history of names; and this is an evil which, if found to a certain
extent in all countries, is particularly rank in Great Britain, where
the language of the country is composed of fragments of half a dozen
languages, which only the learned understand, and which, to the ear of
the many, have no more significance than if they were Hebrew or Coptic.
The composite structure of our English speech, in fact, tends to
conceal from us the natural organism of language; so that in our case,
it requires a special training to make us fully aware of the great
truth announced by Horne Tooke, that “in language there is nothing
arbitrary.” Nevertheless, the curiosity about the meaning of words,
though seldom cherished, is not easily extinguished; and, in this age
of locomotion, there are few scraps of information more grateful to
the intelligent tourist than those which relate to the significance of
topographical names. When, for instance, the London holiday-maker, in
his trip to the West Highlands, setting foot in one of Mr. Hutchinson’s
steamboats at Oban, on his way to the historic horrors of Glencoe,
finds on his larboard side a long, low island, green and treeless,
called <i>Lismore</i>, he will be pleased, no doubt, at first by simply
hearing so euphonious a word in a language that he had been taught
to believe was harsh and barbarous, but will be transported into an
altogether different region of intelligent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[xi]</span> delight when he is made to
understand that this island is wholly composed of a vein of limestone,
found only here in the midst of a wide granitic region skirted with
trap; that, by virtue of this limestone, the island, though treeless,
is more fertile than the surrounding districts; and that for this
reason it has received the Celtic designation of <i>Liosmor</i>, or the
<i>great garden</i>. Connected with this etymology, not only is the
topographical name made to speak reasonably to a reasonable being, but
it contains in its bosom a geological fact, and an œconomical issue,
bound together by a bond of association the most natural and the most
permanent. The pleasant nature of the intelligence thus awakened leads
us naturally to lament that, except to those who are born in Celtic
districts and speak the Celtic language, the significance of so many of
our most common topographical names in the most interesting districts
is practically lost; and it deserves consideration whether, in our
English and classical schools, so much at least of the original speech
of the country should not be taught as would enable the intelligent
student to know the meaning of the local names, to whose parrot-like
repetition he must otherwise be condemned.</p>

<p class="para">Some of the Celtic words habitually used in the designation of
places&mdash;such as <i>Ben</i>, <i>Glen</i>, <i>Strath</i>, and
<i>Loch</i>&mdash;have been incorporated into the common English tongue;
and the addition to this stock is not very large, which would enable
an intelligent traveller to hang the points of his picturesque tour
on a philological peg that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[xii]</span> would most materially insure both their
distinctness and their permanence. Nay, more; the germ of appreciation
thus begotten might lead a sympathetic nature easily into some more
serious occupation with the old language of our country; and this might
lead to a discovery full of pleasant surprise, that in the domain of
words, as of physical growth, the brown moors, when examined, often
produce flowers of the most choice beauty with which the flush of the
most cultivated gardens cannot compete, and that a venerable branch of
the old Indo-European family of languages, generally ignored as rude
and unlettered, is rich in a popular poetry, as fervid in passion, and
as healthy in hue, as anything that Homer or Hesiod ever sang.</p>

<p class="para">In the realm of etymology, as everybody now knows, before Bopp
and Grimm, and other great scholars, laid the sure foundation of
comparative philology on the principles of a philosophy, as all
true philosophy is, at once inductive and deductive, the license of
conjecture played a mad part&mdash;a part, it is only too evident, not yet
fully played out&mdash;and specially raised such a glamour of illusion
about topographical etymology, that the theme became disgusting to all
sober-minded thinkers, or ludicrous, as the humour might be. We must,
therefore, approach this subject with a more than common degree of
caution, anxious rather to be instructed in what is solid, than to be
amazed with what is ingenious. It shall be our endeavour to proceed
step by step in this matter&mdash;patiently, as with the knowledge that our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</span>
foot is on the brink of boggy ground, starting from obvious principles
given by the constitution of the human mind, and confirmed by a large
induction of unquestioned facts.</p>

<p class="para">The most natural and obvious reason for naming a place so-and-so
would be to express the nature of the situation by its most striking
features, with the double view of impressing its character on the
memory, and conveying to persons who had not seen it an idea of its
peculiarity; <i>i.e.</i> the most obvious and natural topographical
names are such as contain condensed descriptions or rude verbal
pictures of the object. Thus the notion of the highest mountain in
a district may be broadly conveyed by simply calling it the <i>big
mount</i>, or, according to the order of words current in the Celtic
languages, <i>mount big</i>; which is exactly what we find in
<span class="smcap">Benmore</span>, from <i>mor</i>, big, the name of several of the
highest mountains in the Highlands of Scotland, specially of one in
the south of Perthshire, near Killin, of another in Mull, the highest
trap mountain in Scotland, and a third in Assynt. Again, to mark the
very prominent feature of mountains elevated considerably above the
normal height, that they are covered with snow all the year round, we
find <span class="smcap">Lebanon</span>, in the north of Palestine, named from the Hebrew
<i>leban</i>, white; <span class="smcap">Mont Blanc</span>, in Switzerland, in the same
way from an old Teutonic word signifying the same thing, which found
its way into Italian and the other Romanesque languages, fairly ousting
the Latin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</span> <i>albus</i>; <span class="smcap">Olympus</span>, from the Greek λάμπομαι, to
shine; the <span class="smcap">Schneekoppe</span>, in Silesia, from <i>schnee</i>, snow,
and <i>koppe</i>, what we call <i>kip</i> in the Lowland topography
of Scotland, <i>i.e.</i> a pointed hill, the same radically as the
Latin <i>caput</i>, the head. In the same fashion one of the modern
names of the ancient Mount Hermon is <i>Jebel-eth-Thelj</i>, the snowy
mountain, just as the Himalayas receive their names from the Sanscrit
<i>haima</i> = Greek χεîμα, winter.</p>

<p class="para">The most obvious characteristic of any place, whether mountain or plain
or valley, would be its shape and size, its relative situation high or
low, behind or in the front, its colour, the kind of rock or soil of
which it is composed, the climate which it enjoys, the vegetation in
which it abounds, and the animals by which it is frequented. Let us
take a few familiar examples of each of these cases; and, if we deal
more largely in illustrations from the Scottish Highlands than from
other parts of the world, it is for three sufficient reasons&mdash;because
these regions are annually visited by the greatest number of tourists;
because, from the general neglect of the Celtic languages, they
stand most in need of interpretation; and because they are most
familiar&mdash;not from book-knowledge only, but by actual inspection&mdash;to
the present writer. In the matter of size, the tourist will find at
<span class="smcap">Glenelg</span> (from <i>sealg</i>, to hunt), in Inverness-shire,
opposite Skye, where there are two well-preserved circular forts, the
twin designations of <span class="smcap">Glenmore</span> and <span class="smcap">Glenbeg</span>; that
is, Glenbig and Glenlittle&mdash;a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[xv]</span> contrast constantly occurring in the
Highlands; the word <i>beag</i>, pronounced vulgarly in Argyleshire
<i>peek</i>, signifying little, evidently the same as μικ in the
Greek μικρός. As to relative situation, the root <i>ard</i>, in
Latin <i>arduus</i>, frequently occurs; not, however, to express
any very high mountain, but either a bluff fronting the sea, as in
<span class="smcap">Ardnamorchuan</span> (the rise of the great ocean, <i>cuan</i>,
perhaps from ὼκεανός), or more frequently a slight elevation on the
shore of a lake, what they call in England a <i>rise</i>, as in
<span class="smcap">Ardlui</span>, near the head of Loch Lomond, <span class="smcap">Ardvoirlich</span>,
and many others. The word <i>lui</i>, Gaelic <i>laogh</i>&mdash;the
<i>gh</i> being silent, as in the English <i>sigh</i>&mdash;signifies
a calf or a fawn, and gives name to the lofty mountain which the
tourist sees on his right hand as he winds up where the railway is
now being constructed from Dalmally to Tyndrum. Another frequent root
to mark relative situation is <span class="allsmcap">CUL</span>, <i>behind</i>, Latin
<i>culus</i>, French <i>cul</i>, a word which gives name to a whole
parish in Aberdeenshire, to the famous historical site of Culross, the
reputed birthplace of St. Kentigern, and many others. This word means
simply <i>behind the headland</i>, as does also <span class="smcap">Culchenzie</span>
(from <i>ceann</i>, the head), at the entrance to Loch Leven and
Glencoe, which the tourist looks on with interest, as for two years
the summer residence of the noble-minded Celtic evangelist Dr. Norman
Macleod. But the most common root, marking relative situation, which
the wanderer through Celtic countries encounters is <i>inver</i>,
meaning below, or the bottom of a stream, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</span> which <i>aber</i> is
only a syncopated form, a variation which, small as it appears, has
given rise to large controversy and no small shedding of ink among
bellicose antiquarians. For it required only a superficial glance to
observe that while <i>Abers</i> are scattered freely over Wales, they
appear scantly in Scotland, and there with special prevalence only in
the east and south-east of the Grampians&mdash;as in <span class="smcap">Aberdeen</span>,
<span class="smcap">Aberdour</span>, <span class="smcap">Aberlemno</span> in Fife, and others. On this the
eager genius of archæological discovery, ever ready to poise a pyramid
on its apex, forthwith raised the theory, that the district of Scotland
where the <i>Abers</i> prevailed had been originally peopled by Celts
of the Cymric or Welsh type, while the region of <i>Invers</i> marked
out the ancient seats of the pure Caledonian Celts. But this theory,
which gave great offence to some fervid Highlanders, so far as it stood
on this argument, fell to the ground the moment that some more cool
observer put his finger on half a dozen or a whole dozen of Invers, in
perfect agreement hobnobbing with the Abers, not far south of Aberdeen;
while, on the other hand, a zealous Highland colonel, now departed to a
more peaceful sphere, pointed out several Abers straggling far west and
north-west into the region of the Caledonian Canal and beyond it. But
these slippery points are wisely avoided; and there can be no doubt, on
the general principle, that relative situation has everywhere played
a prominent part in the terminology of districts. Northumberland and
Sutherland, and Cape <span class="smcap">Deas</span> or Cape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</span> South, in Cantire, are
familiar illustrations of this principle of nomenclature. In such cases
the name, of course, always indicates by what parties it was imposed;
Sutherland, or Southern-land, having received this appellation from the
Orkney men, who lived to the north of the Pentland Firth.</p>

<p class="para">The next element that claims mention is Colour. In this domain the
most striking contrasts are black and white. In ancient Greece, a
common name for rivers was <span class="smcap">Melas</span>, or Black-water; one of
which, that which flows into the Malaic Gulf, has translated itself
into modern Greek as <span class="smcap">Mauro-nero</span>, μαûρο in the popular
dialect having supplanted the classical μἐλας; and νἐρο, as old, no
doubt, as Nereus and the Nereids, having come into its pre-Homeric
rights and driven out the usurping ὕδωρ. In the Scottish Highlands,
<i>dubh</i>, <i>black</i> or <i>dark</i>, plays, as might be expected,
a great figure in topographical nomenclature; of this let <span class="smcap">Benmuic
Dubh</span>, or the <i>mount of the black sow</i>, familiar to many a
Braemar deer-stalker, serve as an example; while <span class="smcap">Cairngorm</span>,
the cradle of many a golden-gleaming gem, stands with its dark blue
(<i>gorm</i>) cap immediately opposite, and recalls to the classical
fancy its etymological congeners in the <span class="smcap">Cyanean</span> rocks, so
famous in early Greek fable. Of the contrasted epithet <i>white</i>,
<span class="smcap">Leucadia</span> (λευκός), where the poetess Sappho is famed to
have made her erotic leap, is a familiar example. In the Highlands,
<i>ban</i> (fair), or <i>geal</i> (white), is much less familiar in
topographical nomenclature than <i>dubh</i>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</span> <span class="smcap">Buidhe</span>, on the
other hand (yellow), corresponding to the ξανθός of the Greeks, is
extremely common, as in <span class="smcap">Lochbuie</span> at the south-east corner
of Mull, one of the few remaining scattered links of the possessions
of the Macleans, once so mighty and latterly so foolish, in those
parts. Among other colours, <i>glas</i> (gray) is very common; so is
<i>dearg</i> (red), from the colour of the rock, as in one of those
splendid peaks that shoot up behind the slate quarries at the west end
of Glencoe. <i>Breac</i>, also (spotted or brindled), is by no means
uncommon, as in <span class="smcap">Ben Vrackie</span>, prominent behind Pitlochrie, in
Perthshire, in which word the initial <i>b</i> has been softened into a
<i>v</i> by the law of aspiration peculiar to the Celtic languages.</p>

<p class="para">There remain the two points of climate and vegetation, of which a
few examples will suffice. In Sicily, the town of <span class="smcap">Selinus</span>,
whose magnificence remains preserved in indelible traces upon the
soil, took its name from the wild parsley, σἐλινον, which grew
plentifully on the ground, and which appears on the coins of the
city. In the Scottish Highlands, no local name is more common than
that which is familiarly known as the designation of one of the most
genuine of the old Celtic chiefs, the head of the clan Macpherson&mdash;we
mean the word <span class="smcap">Cluny</span> (Gaelic <i>cluain</i>; possibly only
a variety of <i>grün</i>, green), which signifies simply a green
meadow, a vision often very delightful to a pedestrian after a
long day’s tramp across brown brae and gray fell in those parts.
The abundance of oak in ancient Celtic regions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">[xix]</span> where it is not
so common now, is indicated by the frequency of the termination
<i>darach</i> (from which <span class="smcap">Derry</span>, in Ireland, is corrupted;
Greek δρûς and δόρυ, as in the designation of one of the Campbells
in Argyle, <span class="smcap">Auchin-darroch</span>, <i>i.e.</i> oak-field. The pine,
<i>giubhas</i>, appears in <span class="smcap">Kingussie</span>, pine-end, in the midst
of that breezy open space which spreads out to the north-west of the
Braemar Grampians. In <span class="smcap">Beith</span> and <span class="smcap">Aultbea</span> (birch-brook)
we have <i>beath</i>, Latin <i>betula</i>, a birch-tree; elm and
ash are rare; heather, <i>fraoch</i>, especially in the designation
of islands, as <span class="smcap">Eileanfraoch</span>, in Loch Awe, and another in
the Sound of Kerrera, close by Oban. Of climate we find traces in
<span class="smcap">Auchnasheen</span> (<i>sian</i>), on the open blasty road between
Dingwall and Janetown, signifying the field of wind and rain; in
<span class="smcap">Mealfourvonie</span>, the broad hill of the frosty moor, composed of
the three roots <i>maol</i> (broad and bald), <i>fuar</i> (cold), and
<i>mhonaid</i> (upland); in <span class="smcap">Balfour</span> (cold town), and in the
remarkable mountain in Assynt called <span class="smcap">Canisp</span>, which appears to
be a corruption of <i>Ceann-uisge</i>, or Rainy-head.</p>

<p class="para">Lastly, of animals: <i>madadh</i>, a fox, appears in <span class="smcap">Lochmaddy</span>
and <span class="smcap">Ardmaddy</span>; <i>coin</i>, of a dog, in <span class="smcap">Achnachoin</span>,
or Dog’s-field, one of the three bloody spots that mark the butchery
of the false Campbell in Glencoe; and, throwing our glance back
two thousand years, in <span class="smcap">Cynoscephalæ</span>, or the Dog’s-head,
in Thessaly, where the sturdy Macedonian power at last bowed in
submission before the proud swoop of the Roman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">[xx]</span> eagles; the familiar
cow (<i>baa</i>, Lat. <i>bos</i>) gives its name to that fair loch,
which sleeps so quietly in the bosom of beautiful Mull; while
the goat, famous also in the sad history of Athenian decline at
<span class="smcap">Aigospotami</span>, or the Goat’s-river, gives its name to the steepy
heights of <span class="smcap">Ardgour</span> (from <i>gobhar</i>, Lat. <i>caper</i>), a
fragment of the old inheritance of the Macleans, which rise up before
the traveller so majestically as he steams northward from Ballachulish
to Fort William and Banavie.</p>

<p class="para">In a country composed almost entirely of mountain ridges, with
intervening hollows of various kinds, it is only natural that the
variety in the scenery, produced by the various slopes and aspects of
the elevated ground, should give rise to a descriptive nomenclature of
corresponding variety. This is especially remarkable in Gaelic; and the
tourist in the Scottish Highlands will not travel far without meeting,
in addition to the <i>Ben</i> and <i>Ard</i> already mentioned, the
following specific designations:&mdash;</p>

<div class="parent">
<ul class="left">
  <li><i>Drum</i>&mdash;a ridge.</li>
  <li><i>Scour</i>&mdash;a jagged ridge or peak.</li>
  <li><i>Cruach</i>&mdash;a conical mountain.</li>
  <li><i>Mam</i>&mdash;a slowly rising hill.</li>
  <li><i>Maol</i>&mdash;a broad, flat, bald mountain.</li>
  <li><i>Monagh</i>&mdash;an upland moor.</li>
  <li><i>Tulloch</i> or <i>Tilly</i>&mdash;a little hill, a knoll.</li>
  <li><i>Tom</i>&mdash;a hillock, a mound.</li>
  <li><i>Tor</i>&mdash;a hillock, a mound.</li>
  <li><i>Bruach</i>&mdash;a steep slope (Scotch brae).</li>
  <li><i>Craig</i>&mdash;crag, cliff.</li>
  <li><i>Cairn</i>&mdash;a heap of stones.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</span></li>
  <li><i>Lairg</i>&mdash;a broad, low slope.</li>
  <li><i>Letter</i>&mdash;the side of a hill near the water.</li>
  <li><i>Croit</i>&mdash;a hump.</li>
  <li><i>Clach</i>&mdash;a stone.</li>
  <li><i>Lech</i>&mdash;a flagstone.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="para">In the Lowlands, <i>pen</i>, <i>law</i>, <i>fell</i>, <i>bræ</i>,
<i>hope</i>, <i>rise</i>, <i>edge</i>, indicate similar varieties.
Among these <i>pen</i>, as distinguished from the northern <i>ben</i>,
evidently points to a Welsh original. <i>Hope</i> is a curious word,
which a south-country gentleman once defined to me as “the point of
the low land mounting the hill whence the top can be seen.” Of course,
if this be true, it means an elevation not very far removed from the
level ground, because, as every hill-climber knows, the top of a huge
eminence ceases to be visible the moment you get beyond what the Greeks
call the “fore-feet” of the mountain.</p>

<p class="para">In the designation of the intervening hollows, or low land, the
variety of expression is naturally less striking. <i>Glen</i> serves
for almost all varieties of a narrow Highland valley. A very narrow
rent or fissured gorge is called a <i>glachd</i>. The English word
<i>dale</i>, in Gaelic <i>dail</i>, means in that language simply
a field, or flat stretch of land at the bottom of the hills. It is
to be noted, however, that this word is both Celtic and Teutonic;
but, in topographical etymology, with a difference distinctly
indicative of a twofold origin. In an inland locality where the
Scandinavians never penetrated, <i>Dal</i> is always prefixed to
the other element of the designation, as in <span class="smcap">Dalwhinnie</span>,
<span class="smcap">Dalnacardoch</span>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</span> and <span class="smcap">Dalnaspidal</span>, the field of
meeting, the field of the smithy, and the field of the hospital, all
in succession within a short distance on the road between the Spey
uplands and Blair Athol. On the other hand, a postfixed <i>dale</i>,
as in <span class="smcap">Borrowdale</span>, <span class="smcap">Easdale</span>, and not a few others,
indicates a Saxon or Norse origin. The word <i>den</i> or <i>dean</i>,
as in the <span class="smcap">Dean Bridge</span>, Edinburgh, and the <span class="smcap">Den Burn</span>,
Aberdeen, is Anglo-Saxon <i>denn</i>, and appears in the English
<span class="smcap">Tenterden</span>, and some others. Another Celtic name for field
is <i>ach</i>, the Latin <i>ag-er</i>, which appears in a number
of Highland places, as in <span class="smcap">Ach-na-cloiche</span> (stone field),
in Argyleshire. A hollow surrounded by mountains is called by the
well-known name of <span class="allsmcap">LAGGAN</span>, which is properly a diminutive
from <i>lag</i>, in Greek λάκκος, in Latin <i>lacus</i>, a hollow
filled with water, and in German a mere <i>loch</i>, or hole, into
which a mouse might creep. A special kind of hollow, lying between
the outstretched arms of a big Ben, and opening at one end into the
vale below, is called in Gaelic <i>coire</i>, literally a cauldron&mdash;a
word which the genius of Walter Scott has made a permanent possession
of the English language. In England such mountain hollows are often
denominated <i>combs</i>, as in <span class="smcap">Addiscombe</span>, <span class="smcap">Ashcomb</span>,
a venerable old British word of uncorrupted Cornish descent, and which,
so far as I know, does not appear in Scottish topography, unless
it be in <span class="smcap">Cummertrees</span> (on the shore, <i>traigh</i>), near
Annan, and <span class="smcap">Cumbernauld</span>; but this I am not able to verify by
local knowledge. The word <i>cumar</i> appears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</span> in O’Reilly’s Irish
dictionary as “the bed of a large river or a narrow sea, a hollow
generally,” but seems quite obsolete in the spoken Gaelic of to-day.
The termination <i>holm</i> is well-known both in English and Scotch
names, and proclaims itself as characteristically Scandinavian, in the
beautiful metropolis of the Swedes. In Gaelic districts a holm, that
is, a low watery meadow, is generally called a <i>lon</i>, a word which
has retained its place in Scotch as <i>loan</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Loaning</span>,
<span class="smcap">Loanhead</span>, <span class="smcap">Loanend</span>, and is fundamentally identical
with the English <i>lane</i> and <i>lawn</i>. The varieties of
sea-coast are expressed by the words <i>traigh</i>, <i>cladach</i>,
<i>camus</i>, <i>corran</i>, <i>wick</i>, <i>loch</i>, <i>rutha</i>,
<i>ross</i>, <i>caolas</i>, <i>stron</i>, <i>salen</i>, among which, in
passing, we may specially note <i>camus</i>, from the root <i>cam</i>,
Greek κάμπτω, to bend: hence <span class="smcap">Morecambe Bay</span>, near Lancaster,
signifies the great bend; <i>corran</i>, a scythe, evidently allied
to the Latin <i>curvus</i>, and used in the Highlands to denote any
crescent-shaped shore, as at Corranferry, Ardgour, in Lochfinne;
<i>wick</i>, a familiar Scandinavian word signifying a bay, and which,
with the Gaelic article prefixed, seems to have blundered itself into
<span class="allsmcap">NIGG</span> at Aberdeen, and near Fearn in Ross-shire; <i>caolas</i>,
a strait, combining etymologically the very distant and very different
localities of <span class="smcap">Calais</span> and <span class="smcap">Ballachulish</span>; <i>stron</i>
or <i>sron</i>, a nose, which lends its name to a parish near the end
of Loch Sunart, in Morvern, and thence to a famous mineral found in its
vicinity; lastly, <i>salen</i> is nothing but salt, and appears in the
south of Ireland and the north-west of Scotland,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</span> under the slightly
varied forms of <span class="smcap">Kinsale</span> and <span class="smcap">Kintail</span>, both of which
words signify the head of the salt water; for Irish and Gaelic are only
one language with a slightly different spelling here and there, and a
sprinkling of peculiar words now and then.</p>

<p class="para">The only other features of natural scenery that play a noticeable
part in topographical etymology are the rivers, lakes, wells, and
waterfalls; and they need not detain us long. The Gaelic <i>uisge</i>,
water, of which the Latin <i>aqua</i> is an abraded form, appears in
the names of Scottish rivers as <i>Esk</i>, and of Welsh rivers as
<i>Usc</i>. The familiar English Avon is the Gaelic <i>amhainn</i>,
evidently softened down by aspiration from the Latin <i>amnis</i>. This
<i>avon</i> often appears at the end of river names curtailed, as in
<span class="smcap">Garonne</span>, the rough river, from the Gaelic root <i>garbh</i>,
rough. The <span class="smcap">Don</span>, so common as a river name from the Black
Sea to Aberdeen, means either the deep river or the brown river. A
small river, <i>brook</i> in English, gives name to not a few places
and persons. In the Scottish Highlands, and in those parts of the
Lowlands originally inhabited by the Celtic race, the word <i>alt</i>
performs the same functions. <i>Loch</i>, in Gaelic, answering to
the English <i>mere</i> (Latin <i>mare</i>), appears most commonly
in the Highlands, as <span class="smcap">Kinloch</span>, <i>i.e.</i> the town or house
at the head of the lake; and <i>tobar</i>, a well, frequently, as
in <span class="smcap">Holywell</span>, connected with a certain religious sanctity,
appears in <span class="smcap">Tobermory</span>, <i>i.e.</i> the well of the Virgin
Mary, one of the most beautiful quiet bits of bay scenery in Great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</span>
Britain. Of places named from waterfalls (<i>eas</i>, from <i>esk</i>),
a significant element in Highland scenery, <span class="smcap">Inverness</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Moness</span> near Aberfeldy, are the most notable, the one
signifying “the town at the bottom of the river, which flows from the
lake where there is the great waterfall,” <i>i.e.</i> <span class="smcap">Foyers</span>;
and the other, “the waterfall of the moorish uplands,” which every one
understands who walks up to it.</p>

<p class="para">So much for the features of unappropriated nature, stereotyped, as
it were, at once and for ever, in the old names of local scenery.
But as into a landscape an artist will inoculate his sentiment and
symbolise his fancy, so on the face of the earth men are fond to
stamp the trace of their habitation and their history. Under this
influence the nomenclature of topography becomes at once changed from
a picture of natural scenery to a record of human fortunes. And in
this department it is plain that the less varied and striking the
features of nature, the greater the necessity of marking places by
the artificial differentiation produced by the presence of human
dwellings. Hence, in the flat, monotonous plains of North Germany, the
abundance of places ending in <i>hausen</i> and <i>heim</i>, which
are only the Saxon forms of our English <i>house</i> and <i>home</i>.
Of the termination <i>hausen</i>, <span class="smcap">Sachsenhausen</span>, the home
of the Saxons, and <span class="smcap">Frankenhausen</span>, the home of the Franks,
are amongst the most notable examples. <i>Heim</i> is pleasantly
associated with refreshing draughts in <span class="smcap">Hochheim</span>, <i>i.e.</i>
high home, on the north bank of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</span> Rhine a little below Mainz,
whence a sharp, clear wine being imported, with the loss of the
second syllable, and the transformation of <i>ch</i> into <i>k</i>,
produced the familiar hock. This <i>heim</i> in a thousand places of
England becomes <i>ham</i>, but in Scotland, where the Celtic element
prevails, appears only rarely in the south-east and near the English
border, as in <span class="smcap">Coldingham</span> and <span class="smcap">Ednam</span>&mdash;the birthplace
of the poet Thomson&mdash;contracted from Edenham. Another root very widely
expressive of human habitation, under the varying forms of <i>beth</i>,
<i>bo</i>, and <i>by</i>, is scattered freely from the banks of Jordan
to the islands of the Hebrides in the north-west of Scotland. First
under this head we have the great army of Hebrew <i>beths</i>, not
a few of which are familiar to our ear from the cherished teachings
of early childhood, as&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bethabara</span>, the house of the ferry;
<span class="smcap">Bethany</span>, the house of dates; <span class="smcap">Bethaven</span>, the house of
naughtiness; <span class="smcap">Bethcar</span>, the house of lambs; <span class="smcap">Bethdagon</span>,
the house of the fish-god Dagon; <span class="smcap">Bethel</span>, the house of God;
<span class="smcap">Bethshemesh</span>, the house of the sun (like the Greek Heliopolis);
and a score of others. <i>Bo</i> is the strictly Danish form of the
root, at least in the dictionary, where the verb <i>boe</i>, to
dwell, also appears. Examples of this are found in <span class="smcap">Skibo</span>,
in Ross-shire, and <span class="smcap">Buness</span>, at the extreme end of Unst, the
seat of the Edmonstones, a family well known in the annals of Shetland
literature; but more generally, in practice, it takes the softened
form of <i>by</i>, as in hundreds of local designations in England,
specially in Lincolnshire,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</span> where the Danes were for a long time at
home. Near the English border, as in <span class="smcap">Lockerby</span>, this same
termination appears; otherwise in Scotland it is rare. In the Sclavonic
towns of Mecklenburg and Prussia, it takes the form of <i>bus</i>,
as in <span class="smcap">Pybus</span>, while in Cornish it is <i>bos</i>, which is a
later form of <i>bod</i> (German <i>bude</i>, English <i>booth</i>,
Scotch <i>bothy</i>), which stands out prominently in Bodmin and other
towns, not only in Cornwall, but in Wales. The termination <i>bus</i>
appears likewise in not a few local designations in the island of
Islay, where the Danes had many settlements. In Skye it appears as
<i>bost</i>, as in <span class="smcap">Skeabost</span>, one of the oldest seats of the
Macdonalds. The other Saxon or Scandinavian terms frequently met with
throughout England and in the north-east of Scotland are&mdash;<i>ton</i>,
<i>setter</i> or <i>ster</i>, <i>stead</i>, <i>stow</i>, <i>stoke</i>,
<i>hay</i>, <i>park</i>, <i>worth</i>, <i>bury</i>, <i>thorp</i>,
<i>toft</i>, <i>thwaite</i>. In Germany, besides <i>heim</i> and
<i>hausen</i>, as already mentioned, we have the English <i>hay</i>,
under the form <i>hagen</i>, a fence; and <i>thorp</i> under the form
<i>dorf</i>, a village; and <i>worth</i> under the forms <i>worth</i>
and <i>werth</i>, which are merely variations of the Greek χόρτος,
English yard, and the Sclavonic <i>gard</i> and <i>gorod</i>, and the
Celtic <i>garad</i>, the familiar word in the Highlands for a stone
wall or dyke. In Germany, also, <i>weiler</i>, from <i>weilen</i>, to
dwell, and <i>leben</i>, to live, are thickly sprinkled; <i>hof</i>,
also, is extremely common, signifying a court or yard&mdash;a suffix which
the French, in that part of Germany which they stole from the Empire,
turned into <i>court</i> or <i>ville</i>, as in <i>Thionville</i> from
<i>Diedenhofen</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</span></p>

<p class="para">So much for the Teutonic part of this branch of topographical
designation. In the Highlands <i>tigh</i> and <i>bail</i> are the
commonest words to denote a human dwelling, the one manifestly an
aspirated form of the Latin <i>tignum</i> (Greek στἐγος, German
<i>dach</i>), and the other as plainly identical with the πόλις which
appears in Sebastopol, and not a few cities, both ancient and modern,
where Greek influence or Greek affectation prevailed. With regard to
<i>bal</i>, it is noticeable that in Ireland it generally takes the
form of <i>bally</i>, which is the full form of the word in Gaelic
also, <i>baile</i>, there being no final mute vowels in that language;
but in composition for topographical use final <i>e</i> is dropped, as
in <span class="smcap">Balmoral</span>, the majestic town or house, from <i>morail</i>,
magnificent, a very apt designation for a royal residence, by whatever
prophetic charm it came to be so named before her present Majesty
learned the healthy habit of breathing pure Highland air amid the
fragrant birches and clear waters of Deeside. <i>Tigh</i>, though less
common than <i>bal</i>, is not at all unfrequent in the mountains; and
tourists in the West Highlands are sure to encounter two of the most
notable between Loch Lomond and Oban. The first, <span class="smcap">Tyndrum</span>,
the house on the ridge, at the point where the ascent ceases as you
cross from Killin to Dalmally; and the other <span class="smcap">Taynuilt</span>, or
the house of the brook, in Scotch burnhouse, beyond Ben Cruachan,
where the road begins to wend through the rich old copsewood towards
Oban. I remember also a curious instance of the word <i>tigh</i> in
a local designation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</span> half-way between Inveraray and Loch Awe. In
that district a little farmhouse on the right of the road is called
<span class="smcap">Tighnafead</span>, <i>i.e.</i> whistle-house (<i>fead</i>, a whistle,
Latin <i>fides</i>), which set my philological fancy immediately on the
imagination that this exposed place was so called from some peculiar
whistling of the blast down from the hills immediately behind; but
such imaginations are very unsafe; for the fact turned out to be, if
somewhat less poetical, certainly much more comfortable, that this
house of call, in times within memory, stood at a greater distance
from the road than it now does, which caused the traveller, when he
came down the descent on a cold night, sharp-set for a glass of strong
whisky, to make his presence and his wish known by a shrill whistle
across the hollow.</p>

<p class="para">So much for <i>tigh</i>. The only other remark that I would make here
is, that the word <i>clachan</i>, so well known from Scott’s Clachan
of Aberfoyle, does not properly mean a village, as Lowlanders are
apt to imagine, but only a churchyard, or, by metonymy, a church&mdash;as
the common phrase used by the natives, <i>Di domhnaich dol do’n
chlachan</i>, “going to church on Sunday,” sufficiently proves&mdash;the
word properly meaning only the stones in the churchyard, which mark the
resting-place of the dead; and if the word is ever used for a village,
it is only by transference to signify the village in which the parish
church is, and the parish churchyard.</p>

<p class="para">But it is not only the dwellings of men, but their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</span> actions, that make
places interesting; and as the march of events in great historical
movements generally follows the march of armies, it follows that
camps and battle-fields and military settlements will naturally have
left strong traces in the topography of every country where human
beings dwell. And accordingly we find that the <i>chester</i> and
the <i>caster</i>, added as a generic term to so many English towns,
are simply the sites of ancient Roman <i>castra</i> or camps; while
Cologne, on the Rhine, marks one of the most prosperous of their
settlements in Germany. Curiously analogous to this is the <i>Cöln</i>,
a well-known quarter of Berlin, on the Spree, where the German emperors
first planted a Teutonic colony in the midst of a Sclavonic population.
In the solemn march of Ossianic poetry, the word <i>blar</i> generally
signifies a field of battle; but, as this word properly signifies only
a large field or open space, we have no right to say that such names as
<span class="smcap">Blair Athol</span> and <span class="smcap">Blairgowrie</span> have anything to do with
the memory of sanguinary collisions. <span class="smcap">Alexandria</span>, in Egypt, is
one of the few remaining places of note that took their name from the
brilliant Macedonian Helleniser of the East. <span class="smcap">Alexandria</span>, in
the vale of Leven, in Dumbartonshire, tells of the family of Smollett,
well known in the annals of Scottish literary genius, and still, by
their residence, adding a grace to one of the most beautiful districts
of lake scenery in the world. <span class="smcap">Adrianople</span> stereotypes the
memory of one of the most notable of the Roman emperors, who deemed it
his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</span> privilege and pleasure to visit the extremest limits of his vast
dominions, and leave some beneficial traces of his kingship there. The
name <span class="smcap">Petersburg</span>, whose Teutonic character it is impossible
to ignore, indicates the civilisation of a Sclavonic country by an
emperor whose early training was received from a people of German blood
and breed; while <span class="smcap">Constantinople</span> recalls the momentous change
which took place in the centre of gravity of the European world, when
the declining empire of the Roman Cæsars was about to become Greek in
its principal site, as it had long been in its dominant culture. The
streets of great cities, as one may see prominently in Paris, in their
designations often contain a register of the most striking events of
their national history. Genuine names of streets in old cities are
a historical growth and an anecdotal record, which only require the
pen of a cunning writer to make them as attractive as a good novel.
London, in this view, is particularly interesting; and Emerson, I
recollect, in his book, <i>How the Great City grew</i> (London,
1862), tells an amusing story about the great fire in London, which
certain pious persons observed to have commenced at a street called
<span class="smcap">Pudding Lane</span>, and ended at a place called <span class="smcap">Pye Corner</span>,
in memory of which they caused the figure of a fat boy to be put up at
Smithfield, with the inscription on his stomach, “This boy is in memory
put up for the late fire of London, occasioned by the sin of gluttony,
1666.” Many a dark and odorous close in Old Edinburgh also, to men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</span>
who, like the late Robert Chambers, could read stones with knowing
eyes, is eloquent with those tales of Celtic adventure and Saxon
determination which make the history of Scotland so full of dramatic
interest; while, on the other hand, the flunkeyism of the persons
who, to tickle the lowest type of aristocratic snobbery, baptized
certain streets of New Edinburgh with <span class="smcap">Buckingham</span> Terrace,
<span class="smcap">Belgrave</span> Crescent, <span class="smcap">Grosvenor</span> Street, and such like
apish mimicry of metropolitan West Endism, stinks in the nostrils and
requires no comment. But not only to grimy streets of reeking towns,
but to the broad track of the march of the great lines of the earth’s
surface, there is attached a nomenclature which tells the history
of the adventurous captain, or the courageous commander, who first
redeemed these regions from the dim limbo of the unknown, and brought
them into the distinct arena of cognisable and manageable facts. In the
frosty bounds of the far North-West, the names of <span class="smcap">Mackenzie</span>,
<span class="smcap">Maclintock</span>, and <span class="smcap">Maclure</span> proclaim the heroic daring
that belongs so characteristically to the Celtic blood in Scotland.
But it is in the moral triumphs of religion, which works by faith
in what is noble, love of what is good, and reverence for what is
great, that the influence of history over topographical nomenclature
is most largely traced. In ancient Greece, the genial piety which
worshipped its fairest Avatar in the favourite sun-god Apollo, stamped
its devotion on the name of <span class="smcap">Apollonia</span>, on the Ionian Sea,
and other towns whose name was legion. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</span> <span class="smcap">Cornwall</span>, almost
every parish is named after some saintly apostle, who, in days of
savage wildness and wastefulness, had brought light and peace and
humanity into these remote regions. In the Highlands of Scotland,
the <span class="smcap">Kilbrides</span> (<i>kill</i> from <i>cella</i>, a shrine),
<span class="smcap">Kilmartins</span>, <span class="smcap">Kilmarnocks</span>, and <span class="smcap">Kilmallies</span>
everywhere attest the grateful piety of the forefathers of the Celtic
race in days which, if more dark, were certainly not more cold than the
times in which we now live. In the Orkneys the civilising influence
of the clergy, or, in some cases, no doubt, their love for pious
seclusion, is frequently marked by the <span class="smcap">Papas</span> or priests’
islands. In Germany, <span class="smcap">Munich</span> or <span class="smcap">Monacum</span>, which shows a
monk in its coat-of-arms, has retained to the present day the zeal for
sacerdotal sanctitude from which it took its name; and the same must
be said of <span class="smcap">Muenster</span>, in Westphalia (from μοναστῆρι, in modern
Greek a cathedral, English minster), the metropolis of Ultramontane
polity and priestly pretension in Northern Germany.</p>

<p class="para">But it is not only in commemorating, like coins, special historical
events, that local names act as an important adjunct to written
records; they give likewise the clue to great ethnological facts and
movements of which written history preserves no trace. In this respect
topographical etymology presents a striking analogy to geology; for,
as the science of the constitution of the earth’s crust reveals a
fossilised history of life in significant succession, long antecedent
to the earliest action<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</span> of the human mind on the objects of terrestrial
nature, so the science of language to the practised eye discloses a
succession of races in regions where no other sign of their existence
remains. If it were doubted, for instance, whether at any period the
Lowlands of Scotland had been possessed by a Celtic race, and asserted
roundly that from the earliest times the plains had been inhabited
by a people of Teutonic blood, and only the mountain district to the
west and north-west was the stronghold of the Celt, the obvious names
of not a few localities in the east and south-east of Scotland would
present an impassable bar to the acceptance of any such dogma. One
striking instance of this occurs in Haddingtonshire, where a parish
is now called <span class="smcap">Garavalt</span>&mdash;by the very same appellation as a
well-known waterfall near Braemar, in the hunting forest of the late
Prince Consort; and with the same propriety in both cases, for the word
in Gaelic signifies a <i>rough brook</i>, and such a brook is the most
striking characteristic of both districts. Cases of this kind clearly
indicate the vanishing of an original Celtic people from districts
now essentially Teutonic both in speech and character. The presence
of a great Sclavonic people in Northern Germany, and of an extensive
Sclavonic immigration into Greece in mediæval times, is attested with
the amplest certitude in the same way. A regular fringe of Scandinavian
names along the north and north-west coast of Scotland would, to the
present hour, attest most indubitably the fact of a Norse dominion
in those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</span> quarters operating for centuries, even had Haco and the
battle of Largs been swept altogether from the record of history and
from the living tradition of the people. To every man who has been in
Norway, <span class="smcap">Laxfiord</span>, in West Ross-shire, a stream well known to
salmon-fishers, carries this Scandinavian story on its face; and no
man who has walked the streets of Copenhagen will have any difficulty,
when he sails into the beautiful bay of Portree, in knowing the meaning
of the great cliff called the <span class="smcap">Storr</span>, which he sees along the
coast a little towards the north; for this means simply the great
cliff, <i>storr</i> being the familiar Danish for great, as <i>mor</i>
is the Gaelic. Ethnological maps may in this way be constructed exactly
in the same fashion as geological; and the sketch of one such for
Great Britain the reader will find in Mr. Taylor’s well-known work on
<i>Names and Places</i>.</p>

<p class="para">With regard to the law of succession in these ethnological strata,
as indicated by topographical nomenclature, the following three
propositions may be safely laid down:&mdash;1. The names of great objects
of natural scenery, particularly of mountains and rivers, will
generally be significant in the language of the people who were
the original inhabitants of the country. 2. Names of places in the
most open and accessible districts of a country will be older than
similar names in parts which are more difficult of access; but&mdash;3,
these very places being most exposed to foreign invasion, are apt
to invite an adventurous enemy, whose settlement in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</span> the conquered
country is generally accompanied with a partial, sometimes with a very
considerable, change of local nomenclature.</p>

<p class="para">In reference to this change of population, Mr. Taylor in one place uses
the significant phrase, “The hills contain the ethnological sweepings
of the plains.” Very true; but the effect of this on the ethnological
character of the population of the places is various, and in the
application requires much caution. It is right, for instance, to say
generally that the Celtic language has everywhere in Europe retreated
from the plains into the mountainous districts; but the people often
still remain where the language has retreated, as the examination of
any directory in many a district of Scotland, where only English is now
spoken, will largely show. In Greece, in the same way, many districts
present only Greek and Sclavonic names of places, where the population,
within recent memory, is certainly Albanian. Inquiries of this nature
always require no less caution than learning; otherwise, as Mr. Skene
observes, what might have been, properly conducted, an all-important
element in fixing the ethnology of any country, becomes, in rash hands
and with hot heads, a delusion and a snare.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p class="para">But the science of language, when wisely conducted, not only presents
an interesting analogy to geological stratification; it sometimes goes
further, and bears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</span> direct witness to important geological changes as
conclusive as any evidence derived from the existing conformation of
the earth’s crust. How this comes to pass may easily be shown by a few
familiar examples. The words <i>wold</i> and <i>weald</i> originally
meant <i>wood</i> and <i>forest</i>, as the Anglo-Saxon Dictionary and
the living use of the German language&mdash;<i>wald</i>&mdash;alike declare; but
the wolds at present known in Yorkshire, Gloucestershire, and other
parts of England, are generally bare and treeless, and in bad weather
very cheerless places indeed. If, then, “there is nothing arbitrary in
language,” and all local names tell an historical tale, it is certain
that, at the time when those names were imposed, these same sites were
part of an immense forest. The geologist, when, in the far-stretching
bogs east of Glencoe, and near Kinloch Ewe, and in many other places
of Scotland, he calls attention to the fact of layers of gigantic
trees lying now deeply embedded under the peat, adduces an argument
with regard to the primitive vegetation of our part of the world not a
whit more convincing. The same fact of a lost vegetation is revealed
in not a few places of England which end in the old word <i>hurst</i>,
signifying a forest. Again, there is a large family of places in
and about the Harz Mountains, in Germany, ending in <i>ode</i>, as
<span class="smcap">Osterode</span>, <span class="smcap">Hasselrode</span>, <span class="smcap">Werningerode</span>, and so
forth. Now most of these places, as specially <span class="smcap">Hasselrode</span>, are
now remarkably free from those leagues of leafy luxuriance that give
such a marked character to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</span> scenery of that mountain district. It
is certain, however, that they were at one time in the centre of an
immense forest; for the word <i>rode</i>, radically the same as our
<i>rid</i>, and perhaps the Welsh <i>rhydd</i>, Gaelic <i>reidh</i>,
simply means “to make clear” or “clean,” and teaches that the forest in
that part had been cleared for human habitation.</p>

<p class="para">Once more: it is a well-known fact in geology that the border limit
between sea and land is constantly changing, the briny element in some
cliffy places, as to the north of Hull, systematically undermining
the land, and stealing away the farmer’s acreage inch by inch and
foot by foot; while in other places, from the conjoint action of
river deposits and tidal currents, large tracts of what was once a
sea-bottom are added to the land. The geological proof of this is open
often to the most superficial observer; but the philological proof,
when you once hold the key of it, is no less patent. In the Danish
language&mdash;which is a sort of half-way house between high German and
English&mdash;the word <i>oe</i> signifies an island. This <i>oe</i>, in
the shape of <i>ay</i>, <i>ea</i>, <i>ey</i>, or <i>y</i>, appears
everywhere on the British coast, particularly in the West Highlands,
as in <span class="smcap">Colonsay</span>, <span class="smcap">Torosay</span>, <span class="smcap">Oransay</span>, and in
<span class="smcap">Orkney</span>; and if there be any locality near the sea wearing
this termination, not now surrounded by water, the conclusion
is quite certain, on philological grounds, that it once was so.
Here the London man will at once think on <span class="smcap">Bermondsey</span> and
<span class="smcap">Chelsea</span>, and he will think rightly; but he must not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxix">[xxxix]</span> be hasty
to draw <span class="smcap">Stepney</span> under the conditions of the same category,
for the EY in that word, if I am rightly informed, is a corruption
from <i>hithe</i>, a well-known Anglo-Saxon and good old English
term signifying a <i>haven</i>; and generally, in all questions of
topographical etymology, there is a risk of error where the old
spelling of the word is not confronted with the form which, by the
attritions and abrasions of time, it may have assumed.</p>

<p class="para">These observations, which at the request of the author of the following
pages I have hastily set down, will be sufficient to indicate the
spirit in which the study of topographical etymology ought to be
pursued. Of course, I have no share in the praise which belongs to the
successful execution of so laborious an investigation; neither, on
the other hand, can blame be attached to me for such occasional slips
as the most careful writer may make in a matter where to err is easy,
and where conjecture has so long been in the habit of usurping the
place of science. But I can bear the most honest witness to the large
research, sound judgment, and conscientious accuracy of the author;
and feel happy to have my name, in a subsidiary way, connected with a
work which, I am convinced, will prove an important addition to the
furniture of our popular schools.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="allsmcap">AA</span>, <span class="allsmcap">A</span> (Scand.),</div>

<p>a stream; from Old Norse <i>â</i>, Goth. <i>aha</i>, Old Ger.
<i>aha</i> (water). The word, in various forms, occurs frequently in
river names throughout Western Europe, especially in Germany and the
Netherlands, and often takes the form of <i>au</i> or <i>ach</i>;
<i>e.g.</i> the rivers Aa, Ach, Aach; Saltach (salt river); Wertach
(a river with many islands)&mdash;<i>v.</i> <span class="allsmcap">WARID</span>, etc.; Trupach
(troubled stream); Weser, <i>i.e.</i> <i>Wesar-aha</i> (western
stream); Lauter, <i>i.e.</i> <i>Hlauter-aha</i> (clear stream); Danube
or Donau, <i>i.e.</i> <i>Tuon-aha</i> (thundering stream); Main,
<i>i.e.</i> <i>Magin-aha</i> (great stream); Fisch-aha (fish stream);
Schwarza (black stream); Zwiesel-au (the stream of the whirlpool);
Erlach (alder-tree stream); Gron-aha (green stream); Dachau (the clayey
stream); Fulda, <i>i.e.</i> <i>Fold-aha</i> (land stream); Rod-aha
(reedy stream); Saale and Saala from <i>salz</i> (salt stream). The
simple <i>a</i> or <i>o</i>, with a prefix expressive of the character
of the stream, is the most frequent form of the word in Iceland and
Scandinavia, and in the districts of Great Britain colonised by
Norsemen or Danes; <i>e.g.</i> Laxa (salmon river); Hvita (white
river); Brora (bridge river); Rotha (red river); Greta (weeping river);
Storaa (great river); Thurso (Thor’s river), which gives its name to
the town; Lossie, anc. <i>Laxi-a</i> (salmon river).</p>

<p>water; <i>e.g.</i> Doab (the district of two waters); Menab (the mouth
of the water), on the Persian Gulf; Busheab or <i>Khoshaub</i> (good
water), a river in Hindostan, also an island in the Persian Gulf;
Neelab (blue water); Punjaub (the district of the five streams); Chinab
or Chenaub R., said to be a corrupt. of its former name <i>Chaudra
Bhagee</i> (the garden of the moon), so called from a small lake
of that name from which it proceeds. Cognate with this root is the
Gadhelic <i>abh</i>, in its forms of <i>aw</i> or <i>ow</i>. Thus in
Scotland we have the River Awe and Loch Awe; in Ireland, Ow and Owbeg
(little stream); Ow-nageerah (the stream of the sheep); Finnow (clear
stream). Cognate with these root-words is the Lat. <i>aqua</i> and its
derivations in the Romance languages, as well as <i>ae</i> or <i>ea</i>
(A.S. water). Forsteman finds river names, allied to the foregoing,
throughout Germany and France, in such forms as <i>ap</i>, <i>op</i>,
<i>ep</i>, etc., as in the Oppa, Lennep, Barop, Biberaffa.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="allsmcap">ABAD</span> (Pers. and Sansc.),</div>

<p>a dwelling or town, generally connected with the name of its founder;

(Gael.),</div>

<p>a confluence of waters; applied, in topography, to places at the conf.
of streams, or at the embouchure of a river. The derivation of the term
has been traced by some etymologists to the conjunction of <i>ath</i>
(Gael.), a ford, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span> <i>bior</i>, water; by others to Cym.-Cel.
<i>at</i> (at) and <i>bior</i> (water). This prefix is general in
many of the counties of Scotland, throughout Wales, and, in a few
instances, in Ireland, although in the latter country the synonyms
<i>inver</i> and <i>cumar</i> are more frequent. Both words are found
in the topography of the Picts, but the Scots of Argyleshire used only
<i>inver</i> before they came from Ireland to settle in that district.
The word <i>aber</i> seems to have become obsolete among them; and as
there are no <i>abers</i> in Ayrshire, Renfrew, and Lanarkshire, the
word had probably become obsolete before the kingdom of Strathclyde
was formed. Dr. Joyce, in his <i>Irish Names of Places</i>, traces
its use as prefix or affix to the Irish root <i>abar</i> (a mire),
as in the little stream Abberachrinn (<i>i.e.</i> the river of the
miry place of the tree). In Wales we find Aberconway, Aberfraw,
Aberistwyth, Aberavon, Aberayron, Aberdare, Aberdaron, Abergavenny,
at the embouchure of the <i>Conway</i>, <i>Fraw</i>, <i>Istwyth</i>,
<i>Avon</i>, <i>Aeron</i>, <i>Dar</i>, <i>Daron</i>, <i>Gavenny</i>.
Barmouth, corrupt. from Aber-Mowddy, a seaport in Merioneth, at the
mouth of the R. Mowddy. Berriew, corrupt. from Aber-Rhiw (at the
junction of the R. Rhiw with the Severn); Aberdaugledden, the Welsh
name for Haverford-west, at the mouth of twin rivers resembling two
swords (<i>gledden</i>), which unite at Milford Haven. It is called
by the Welsh now Hwlford (the sailing road) because the tide comes up
to the town. Aberhonddu, at the mouth of the R. Honddi or Honddu (the
county town of Brecknock), and Aberdovey, at the embouchure of the R.
Dovey in Wales. In Scotland, Aberbrothwick or Arbroath, Abercorn, anc.
<i>Aeber-curnig</i>, Aberdour, Abergeldie, Abernethy, at the embouchure
of the <i>Brothock</i>, <i>Cornie</i>, <i>Dour</i>, <i>Geldie</i>, and
<i>Nethy</i>. Aberchirder is <i>Abhir-chiar-dur</i> (the conf. of the
dark water); Abercrombie (the curved conf.); Aberfeldy, <i>i.e.</i>
<i>Abhir-feathaile</i> (the smooth conf.); Aberfoyle (the conf. of
the pool, <i>phuill</i>); Aberlemno (the conf. of the leaping water,
<i>leumnach</i>); Arbirlot, anc. <i>Aber-Elliot</i> (at the mouth
of the Elliot); Applecross for <i>Abhir-croisan</i> (the conf. of
trouble); Old Aberdeen and New Aberdeen, at the mouths of the Don and
Dee, Lat. <i>Devana-castra</i>; Fochabers (the <i>plain</i>, at the
river mouth), Gael. <i>faigh</i>, a plain; Lochaber (at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span> mouth
of the loch); Barmouth, in Wales, corrupt, of <i>Aber-Mawdoch</i> or
<i>Maw</i>.</p>

<p>a frequent element in river names, with various and even opposite
meanings. Some of the river names may have come from the Sansc.
<i>ara</i> (swift, or the flowing), and in Tamil <i>aar</i> means
simply a river. There is another Sanscrit word <i>arb</i> (to ravage
or destroy), with which the Gadhelic words <i>garw</i>, <i>garbh</i>
(rough) may be connected; and, on the other hand, there is the Welsh
<i>araf</i> (gentle). According to the locality and the characteristics
of the stream, one must judge to which of these roots its name may
belong. There are, in England, the Aire, Arre, Arro, Arrow; in France,
the Arve, Erve, Arveiron, etc.; in Switzerland and Germany, the Aar,
Are; in Spain and Italy, the Arva, Arno; and in Scotland, the Ayr,
Aray, Irvine, etc. Many of these names may signify simply flowing water
(the river), while others beginning with the syllable <i>ar</i> may be
referred to the adjectival forms, <i>araf</i>, <i>arb</i>, <i>ara</i>,
or <i>garbh</i>, followed by another root-word for <i>water</i>, as in
Arrow (the swift stream); Yarrow (the rough stream); <i>ow</i> (water);

<p>a general name among the Celts for a town&mdash;so called, apparently, from
the Celtic words <i>braigh</i>, <i>brugh</i>, <i>brig</i> (a heap,
pile, or elevation), because the nucleus of towns, among uncivilised
tribes in early times, were merely fortified places erected on heights;
cognate with the Teut. and Scand. <i>burg</i>, <i>byrig</i>, the Sclav.
<i>brieg</i> (an embankment or ridge), and the Scottish <i>brae</i> (a
rising ground). Hence the name of the <i>Brigantes</i> (dwellers on
hills); the word <i>Brigand</i> (literally, a mountaineer); Briançon,
anc. <i>Brigantium</i> (the town on the height); Brieg, a town in
Silesia; Braga and Bragança, fortified cities in Portugal; Talavera,

mountain, <i>riabhach</i>); the Brerachin, a river and district<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span> in
Perthshire; Brugh and Bruighean, in Ireland, signifying originally
a hill, was subsequently applied to a palace or a distinguished
residence. The term, as applied to the old residences, presupposed the
existence of a fortified brugh or rath, several of which still remain.
The word has suffered many corruptions: thus Bruree, in Limerick, is
from <i>Brugh-righ</i> (the king’s fort); and <i>Bruighean</i> (little
fort) has been transformed into Bruff, Bruis, Bruce, or Bryan. The
word <i>briva</i>, on the other hand, was generally applied to towns
situated on rivers&mdash;as in Amiens, anc. <i>Samarabrina</i>, on the R.
Somme&mdash;and was gradually used as synonymous with <i>pons</i> (bridge),

<p>a town or city, literally an enclosed and fortified dwelling, from

were often erected on heights for security, as well as to enable their

was originally applied to a circle of stones where the Pagan rites
of worship were wont to be celebrated; and, after the introduction
of Christianity, houses and churches were erected near these spots,
and thus clachan came to mean a hamlet; and, at the present day, the
expression used in asking a person if he is going to church is&mdash;“<i>Am
bheil-thu’dol do’n clachan?</i>” (<i>i.e.</i> “Are you going to the
stones?”) There is the Clachan of Aberfoyle in Perthshire; and in
Blair-Athole there is a large stone called <i>Clach n’iobairt</i>
(the stone of sacrifice). In Skye there is <i>Clach-na-h-Annat</i>
(the stone of Annat, the goddess of victory); and those remarkable
Druidical remains, called rocking-stones, are termed in Gaelic
<i>Clach-bhraeth</i> (the stone of knowledge), having been apparently
used for divination. There are others called <i>Clach-na-greine</i>

<p>an affix used by the Teutonic races, as a patronymic, in the same
sense as <i>Mac</i> is used in Scotland, <i>ap</i> in Wales,
and <i>O</i> in Ireland. <i>Ing</i> is generally affixed to the
settlement of a chief, and <i>ingen</i> to that of his descendants.
<i>Ing</i>, preceding <i>ham</i>, <i>ton</i>, <i>dean</i>, <i>ley</i>,
<i>thorp</i>, <i>worth</i>, etc., is generally an abbreviation of
<i>ingen</i>, and denotes that the place belonged to the family
of the tribe, as in Bonnington, Collington, Collingham, Islington
(the home of the Bonnings, the Collings, and the Islings). In
French topography <i>ingen</i> takes the forms of <i>igny</i>,
<i>igné</i>, or <i>inges</i>; and it appears, by comparing the names
of many towns and villages in England and the north-west of France
with those of Germany, that Teutonic tribes forming settlements in
these countries transferred the names in their native land to their
new homes. For the full elucidation of this subject reference may
be made to Taylor’s <i>Words and Places</i>, chap. vii. and the
Appendix, and to Edmund’s <i>Names of Places</i>, p. 58. Only a few
examples of the use of this patronymic can be given here; thus, from
the <i>Offings</i>&mdash;Oving and Ovingham, corresponding to the Ger.
Offingen and the Fr. Offignes. From the <i>Eppings</i>&mdash;Epping, Ger.
Eppinghofen, and Fr. Epagne. The <i>Bings</i>&mdash;Bing, Bingham, Bingley;
Ger. Bingen; Fr. Buigny. The <i>Basings</i>&mdash;Eng. Basing, Basingham,
Bessingby; Fr. Bazigny. From the <i>Raedings</i>&mdash;Reading, Co. Berks.
The <i>Harlings</i>&mdash;Harlington. The <i>Billings</i>&mdash;Bellington.
From the <i>Moerings</i> or <i>Merovingians</i> many French towns and
villages are named; <i>e.g.</i> Morigny, Marigné, Merignac, Merrigny;
in England&mdash;Merring, Merrington. We can sometimes trace these tribe
names to the nature of the localities which they inhabited. Thus the
<i>Bucings</i>, from which we have Boking and Buckingham, to a locality
abounding in beech-trees, <i>boc</i>; the <i>Durotriges</i>, from
which we have Dorset and Dorchester, are the dwellers by the water,
<i>dur</i>; as well as the <i>Eburovices</i>, who gave their name to
Evreux, in France. <i>Ing</i>, also, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span> A.S. names, sometimes means a
meadow, as in Clavering, in Essex (clover meadow), A.S. <i>Claefer</i>;

<p>an enclosure, a church, a house; but Mr. Skene considers that the Cel.
<i>llan</i> comes from the Lat. <i>planum</i> (a level place), just as
the Gael. <i>lan</i> (full) comes from the Lat. <i>plenus</i>. This
word is more common in Welsh names than in the topography of Ireland
and Scotland, and in its signification of a church forms the groundwork
of a vast number of Welsh names. In Ireland it means a house as well
as a church, as in Landbrock (the badger’s house); Landmore (the great
church), in Londonderry; Landahussy (O’Hussy’s church), in Tyrone;
Lanaglug (the church of the bells). It is not so frequent in Scotland,

<i>Ard-na-Molas</i>, the height of St. Molios, who lived in a cave
there, seems to be the church or enclosure of this saint; Lambride,
in Forfar, is <i>Lannbride</i> (St. Bridget’s church); Lumphanan is
from <i>Lann-Finan</i> (St. Finan’s church). The derivation of Lanark,
anc. <i>Lanerk</i>, is probably from the Welsh <i>Llanerch</i> (a
distinct spot or fertile piece of ground). There are many examples
of this root in Brittany; <i>e.g.</i> Lanleff (the enclosure on the
R. Leff); Lanmeur (great church); Lannion (the little enclosure);
Landerneau and Lannoy (the enclosure on the water); but in French
topography the Teut. <i>land</i> generally signifies uncultivated
ground; <i>e.g.</i> La Lande, Landes, Landelles, La Landelle, Les
Landais, Landau, etc.&mdash;<i>v.</i> Cocheris’s <i>Noms de Lieu</i>.
Launceston, in Cornwall, is probably corrupt. from <i>Llan-Stephen</i>.
The greatest number of our examples must be taken from Wales. There

<span class="allsmcap">TUN</span> (Scand.),</div>

<p>an enclosure, a town. The primary meaning of this word comes from the
Gothic <i>tains</i>, Scand. <i>teinn</i>, Ger. <i>zaun</i>, a fence or
hedge formed of twigs. Originally it meant a place rudely fortified
with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span> stakes, and was applied to single farm-steadings and manors,
in which sense <i>tun</i> is still used in Iceland, and <i>toon</i>
in Scotland. The word <i>toon</i> retained this restricted meaning
even in England in the time of Wickliffe. These single enclosures
became the nucleus of a village which, gradually increasing, became a
town or city, in the same manner as villages and towns arose around
the Celtic <i>duns</i>, <i>raths</i>, and <i>lises</i>. This root,
in the names of towns and villages, is more common than any other in
Anglo-Saxon topography, being an element in an eighth part of the names
of dwelling-places in the south of Great Britain. The greatest number
of these names is connected with those of the original proprietors
of the places, of which but a few examples can be given here. In
such cases, the root <i>ton</i> is generally preceded by <i>s</i> or
<i>ing</i>&mdash;<i>qu. v.</i>; <i>e.g.</i> Grimston, Ormiston, Ribston,
Haroldston, Flixton, Kennington (the property of Grim, Orm, Hreopa,
Harold, and Felix); Canewdon (of Canute); Addlington and Edlington

<p>foreign. These words were applied by the Teutonic and Sclavonic
nations to all foreigners, and to the countries inhabited or colonised
by those who did not come from a Teutonic stock or speak their
language. In the charters of the Scoto-Saxon kings the Celtic Picts
of Cambria and Strathclyde were called <i>Wallenses</i>; <i>e.g.</i>
Wales, <i>Gwalia</i>&mdash;root <i>gwal</i> or <i>gall</i>, foreign. The
Welsh call their own country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span> <i>Cymru</i> (the abode of the Kymry
or aborigines)&mdash;(the home of the Cymric Celts), so named by the
Saxons; Wallachia (the strangers’ land, <i>vlach</i>), so called by
the Germans and Sclaves because colonised by the Romans; Walcherin,
anc. <i>Walacria</i> or <i>Gualacra</i> (the island of the strangers
or Celts); Cornwall (the horn or promontory of the Celts); also
Cornuailles (a district in Brittany peopled by British emigrants from
Wales); Wallendorf (the town of the strangers), the German name for
<i>Olaszi</i> or <i>Olak</i>, in Hungary, peopled by Wallachians;
Wallenstadt and Wallensee (the town and lake on the borders of the
Romansch district of the Grisons, conquered by the Romans under
Constantius); Wâlschland, the German name for Italy. The Celts of
Flanders were also called Walloons by their German neighbours; and
Wlachowitz, in Moravia, means the town of the Wallachs or strangers.
The Gadhelic <i>gall</i> (foreign), although used with the same meaning
as <i>wealh</i>, is not connected with it. It is a word that has
been applied to strangers by the Irish from the remotest antiquity;
and as it was applied by them to the natives of Gaul (<i>Galli</i>),
<i>gall</i>, in the first instance, might mean simply a native
of Gaul. It was afterwards used in reference to the Norwegians,
<i>Fionn-ghaill</i> (the <i>fair</i>-haired strangers); and to the
Danes, <i>Dubh-ghaill</i> (the <i>dark</i>-haired strangers); and in
connection with them and with the English the word enters largely into
Irish topography; <i>e.g.</i> Donegal, <i>i.e.</i> <i>Dun-nau-Gall</i>
(the fortress of the foreigners or Danes); Clonegall and Clongall (the
meadow of the strangers); Ballynagall and Ballnagall (the town of the
strangers, or English). For the further elucidation of these words
<i>v.</i> <i>Irish Names of Places</i>, by Dr. Joyce, and <i>Words
and Places</i>, by the Rev. Isaac Taylor. The words <i>Gaill</i> and
<i>Gallda</i> are applied by the Highlanders of Scotland to their

<p>a dwelling, a village, a town&mdash;a word in general use in the topography
of Great Britain, as well as on the continent, but with various
meanings. According to Leo, the Teut. <i>wich</i> or <i>vichs</i>
arose from the root <i>waes</i>, A.S., and <i>wiese</i>, Ger. (a moist
meadow) and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span> hence was applied to places situated on low lands, often
on the bank of a stream; <i>e.g.</i> Meeswyk (the town on the Maas);
Beverwyk, on the Bever. The primary meaning seems to have been a
station&mdash;with the Anglo-Saxons a station or abode on the <i>land</i>,
with the Norsemen a station for <i>ships</i>. The root of the word runs
through all the Aryan languages&mdash;Sansc. <i>veça</i>, Grk. <i>oikos</i>,
Pol. <i>wies</i>, Ir. <i>fieh</i>, Cym.-Cel. <i>qwic</i>, all meaning
an abode; <i>e.g.</i> Alnwick (the town on the R. Alne); Ipswich, anc.
<i>Gippenswich</i>, on the Gipping; York, A.S. <i>Eorvic</i>, Lat.
<i>Eboracum</i>, Welsh <i>Caer-Ebreuc</i> (the town on the water,
or R. Eure); Hawick (the town on the haugh or low meadow); Noordwyk
(north town); Nederwyk (lower town); Zuidwyk and Zuick (south town),
in Holland and Belgium; Harwich (army town), so called from having
been a Saxon station or military depot; Keswick (the town of Cissa);
Wickware, in Gloucestershire (the town of the family of De la Ware). On
the other hand, the Scandinavian <i>wich</i> or <i>vig</i> signifies a
bay, or a place situated on the coast, or at the mouth of a river&mdash;thus
Schleswick (on a bay formed by the R. Schlie), in Prussia; Wick (the
town on the bay), in Caithness; Sandwich (the town on the sandy bay);
Lerwick (on the muddy bay); Greenwich, Scand. <i>Granvigen</i> (the
town on the pine bay); Reikjavik, in Iceland (the reeky or smoky
bay); Vigo in Spain, and Vaage in Norway (on spacious bays); Swanage,
in Dorset, anc. <i>Swanwick</i> (Sweyen’s bay town); Brodick, in
Arran (the broad bay town); Wicklow, in Ireland, probably Danish
<i>Vigloe</i> (bay shelter), used by the Danes as a ship station;
Smerwick (butter bay); Berwick, contracted from <i>Aberwick</i> (at
the mouth of the R. Tweed)&mdash;<i>v.</i> <span class="allsmcap">ABER</span>. <i>Wiche</i>
also denotes a place where there are salt mines or springs, and in
this sense is probably connected with the Scand. <i>vig</i>, as salt
was often obtained by the evaporation of sea-water in shallow bays;
thus Nantwich&mdash;<i>v.</i> <span class="allsmcap">NANT</span>; Middlewich (the middle salt
works); Droitwich, Lat. <i>Salinæ</i> (the salt springs, where the
<i>droit</i> or tax was paid). In some cases <i>wich</i> or <i>wick</i>
is derived from the Lat. <i>vicus</i>, cognate with the Grk.
<i>oikos</i> and Sansc. <i>veça</i> (a dwelling)&mdash;thus Katwyk-sur-mer
and Katwyk-sur-Rhin are supposed to occupy the site of the Roman
<i>Vicus-Cattorum</i> (the dwelling-place of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span> the Chatti); Vick or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
